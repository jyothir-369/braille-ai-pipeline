1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to identify, do copyright
research on, transcribe and proofread works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™ electronic works, and the medium on
which they may be stored, may contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual property infringement, a defective or
damaged disk or other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you received the work on a physical
medium, you must return the medium with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund. If you received the work
electronically, the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If the second copy is also defective, you may demand a

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the
widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of
the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching
Project Gutenberg™’s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain freely
available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created
to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To learn more
about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue
Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to
carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely
distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated
equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status
with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all
50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort,
much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations
in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or
determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation
requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states
who approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax
treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations
are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic
works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as
not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™, including how to make donations to the
Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
